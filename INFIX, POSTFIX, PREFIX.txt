
	Infix, Postfix, Prefix.

	Evaluation of expressions
	2 + 3
	A + B   All of them have <operand> <operator> <operand>  = INFIX
	(p * 2)

	Operand -> object on which operation is performed
	For instance: A -> operand; + -> operator; B -> operator.	

	Infix.
	2 + 3 = 5
	4 + 6 * 2 -> we have to set a order of solving. 
	Order of operation:
	1) Parentheses () {} []
	2) Exponents (right to left)
	3) Multiplication and division
	4) Addition and subtraction

	Prefix (Polish notation)
	<operator> <operand> <operand>
	Infix     Prefix       Postfix
	2 + 3     + 2 3        2, 3+
	p - q     -pq          pq-
	a+b*c     +a*bc        abc*+  

	Postfix is reverse polish notation.  

	Infix is human readable and Postfix and Prefix are good for machines to save some memory
