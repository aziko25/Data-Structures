
	Introduction To Stack.

	Stack ADT (Abstract Data Type)

	Stack is a collection with item that can be put from the top and removed from the top.

	Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)

	Stack - is a list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end called the top.

	Operations: 
	1) Push(x) - inserting
	2) Pop() - removing
	3) Top()
	4) IsEmpty()
	Their time comlpexity is O(1)

	Stack is represented like:
	|         |
	|	  |
	|	  | - its empty
	|	  |
	|_________|
             S

	If we want to add a number "2" then we write Push(2)
	|         |
	|	  |
	|	  |
	|_________|
	|    2    |
        |_________|  
	     S	    

	If we want to add another number "10" then we write Push(10)
	|         |
	|_________|
	|    10	  |
	|_________|
	|    2    |
        |_________|  
	     S	     and etc.

	If we want to remove, we write Pop()
	|         |
	|	  |
	|	  |
	|_________|
	|    2    |
        |_________|  
	     S	    

	If write Top() it will return you the number which is at the top. 
	IsEmpty() will give you "false", because there are num in the stack.

	Applications of stack:
	- Function calls / Recursion
	- Undo operation (Ctrl Z)
	- Balanced Parentheses, for example: { () }
